To run the solution e.g. on Ubuntu Desktop 22.04:
1. sudo apt upgrade -y
2. sudo apt install -y git curl docker docker-compose python3-pip jq vim
3. sudo pip3 install influxdb
4. sudo usermod -aG docker coach 
5. curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
6. aws configure. Then reboot the machine
7. ./install.sh
8. populate the DynamoDB
batch mode:
9. Fix API ID in the logparser_batch.py application and run it as may times as you need
real-time mode:
9. Fix API ID in the logparser_realtime.py application and run it once
10. configure Grafana to use influxDB as a source
11. configure Grafana dashboards and plots

While running, the solution will produce expected error:
"An error occurred (InvalidOperationException) when calling the CancelExportTask operation: The specified export task has already finished". This erro is generated by the CancelExportTask operation. The CancelExportTask is run to stop the previous log export task, if it is still running. AWS log subsystem can run only one export task at a time.
