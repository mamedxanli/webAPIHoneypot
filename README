To run the solution e.g. on Ubuntu Desktop 22.04:
1. Run sudo apt upgrade -y
2. Run sudo apt install -y git curl docker docker-compose python3-pip jq vim
3. Run sudo pip3 install influxdb
4. Run sudo usermod -aG docker coach 
5. Run curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
Run unzip awscliv2.zip
Run sudo ./aws/install
6. Run aws configure. 
7. Reboot the machine
8. Run ./install.sh
9. populate the DynamoDB
10. For batch mode: Fix API ID in the logparser_batch.py application and run it as may times as you need
or
10. For real-time mode: Fix API ID in the logparser_realtime.py application and run it once. The application will continue to run
11. configure Grafana to use influxDB as a source
12. configure Grafana dashboards and plots

While running, the solution will produce expected error:
"An error occurred (InvalidOperationException) when calling the CancelExportTask operation: 
The specified export task has already finished". 
This error is generated by the CancelExportTask operation. 
The CancelExportTask is run to stop the previous log export task, if it is still running. 
AWS log subsystem can run only one export task at a time.
