To deploy the near real-time version of the web API honeypot I followed these these steps: 

1. sudo apt upgrade -y
2. sudo apt install -y git curl docker docker-compose python3-pip jq vim
3. sudo pip3 install influxdb
4. sudo usermod -aG docker coach 
5. curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
6. aws configure
7. run install.sh
8. populate the DynamoDB
9. Logoff and log on. Then start docker-compose containers
10. Fix API ID in the logparser.py application and run it e.g. via crontab or similar scheduler
11. configure Grafana to use influxDB as a source
12. configure Grafana dashboards and plots

While running, the solution will produce expected error:
"An error occurred (InvalidOperationException) when calling the CancelExportTask operation: The specified export task has already finished". This erro is generated by the CancelExportTask operation. The CancelExportTask is run to stop the previous log export task, if it is still running. AWS log subsystem can run only one export task at a time.
