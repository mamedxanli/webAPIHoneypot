To deploy the near real-time version of the web API honeypot follow these steps: 

1. sudo apt install -y curl docker docker-compose python3-pip jq
2. sudo pip3 install influxdb
3. sudo usermod -aG docker coach 
4. curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
5. Logoff and log on. Then start docker-compose containers
6. Fix API ID in the logparser.py application and run it e.g. via crontab or similar scheduler
7. configure Grafana to use influxDB as a source
8. configure Grafana dashboards and plots

While running, the solution will produce expected error:
"An error occurred (InvalidOperationException) when calling the CancelExportTask operation: The specified export task has already finished". This erro is generated by the CancelExportTask operation. The CancelExportTask is run to stop the previous log export task, if it is still running. AWS log subsystem can run only one export task at a time.
