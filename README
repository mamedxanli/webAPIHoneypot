To deploy the near real-time version of the web API honeypot follow these steps: 

1. Download and install AWS CLI (2.9.1)

curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

2. Install docker ver. 20.10.12
3. install docker-compose ver. 1.29.2
4. download and install python3-pip
5. install jq
pip3 install influxdb
add your user to the local docker group
5. run aws configure
6. start docker-compose containers
7. Schedule logparser.py application to run via crontab or similar scheduler
8. configure Grafana to use influxDB as a source
9. configure Grafana dashboards and plots

While running, the solution will produce expected error:
"An error occurred (InvalidOperationException) when calling the CancelExportTask operation: The specified export task has already finished". This erro is generated by the CancelExportTask operation. The CancelExportTask is run to stop the previous log export task, if it is still running. AWS log subsystem can run only one export task at a time.
